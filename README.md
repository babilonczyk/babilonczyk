##  Hi there ^^

I'm a ruby on rails developer looking for challenging projects that could broaden my horizons, as well as, sharpen my skillset. Energy drinks and coffee gives me power to do unachievable things.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on polearn -> https://github.com/babilonczyk/rails-polearn

    Why? To learn/practice RSpec, Service Objects, Form Objects, OAuth

## Old Projects:

ðŸš€ Ruby-blackjack -> https://github.com/babilonczyk/ruby-blackjack

    Why? To Practice OOP in Ruby, RSpec
