##  Hi there 👋

I'm a ruby on rails developer looking for challenging projects that could broaden my horizons, as well as, sharpen my skillset. Energy drinks and coffee gives me power to do unachievable things.

    Why? To learn/practice RSpec, Service Objects, Form Objects, OAuth

## Old Projects:

🚀 Ruby-blackjack -> https://github.com/babilonczyk/ruby-blackjack

    Why? To Practice OOP in Ruby, RSpec
    
🚀 React Portfolio -> https://github.com/babilonczyk/react-portfolio   
▶️ Live demo -> https://babilonczyk.github.io/react-portfolio/

    Why? To Show understanding of HTML, CSS/SCSS, and basic JS/React concepts
