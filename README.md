## Hi there 👋🏻

`Pragmatic Software Developer`

Hi, my name is Jan and I'm a full-stack software developer with over 3yr of experience. I like working on small and big codebases, tackling the unknown. My goal is to be a generalist who can bring value regardless of the stage the project is in. Coffee lover -  gives me power to do unachievable things ⚡⚡⚡
